The executable contains a text based version of battleships with the following rules/instructions.

Objective: Sink all 5 of the computers ships before you run out of ammunition
To fire at a ship type '1' and then enter a co-ordinate in the following format (column)(row), this will look like 1a, 5g, 9c.
If you want to target the 10th column you must use '#', this will look like #b, #e, #j".
The computer's five ships consist of an aircraft carrier (5 cells), a battleship (4 cells), a destroyer (3 cells), a submarine (3 cells)
and a patrol boat (2 cells).
If you miss a target an 'X' will be placed in the targeted cell, if you hit a ship then an 'H' will be placed in the targeted cell.
When you sink a ship the 'H' cells will turn into a letter representing the ship you just destroyed.
